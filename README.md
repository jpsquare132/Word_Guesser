🎯 Word Guesser: The Challenge

📝 Overview

Word Guesser is a concise command-line game where the player attempts to crack a secret word using length hints and limited attempts. It’s a fun way to test vocabulary and deduction!

🚀 How to Play

Game Objective

The goal is to guess the secret word exactly (case-insensitive) before you run out of three attempts.

# Rules & Hints

You have a maximum of 3 attempts to guess the word.

After each incorrect guess, the game tells you how many tries you have left.

You receive a helpful length hint:

If your guess is shorter than the secret word, you get the hint: 
Hint: Your guess is too short.

If your guess is longer than the secret word, you get the hint: 
Hint: Your guess is too long.

If your guess has the correct number of letters, you get the hint: 
Hint: Your guess is the correct length.

The game is not case-sensitive (e.g., "PYTHON" is treated the same as "python").
